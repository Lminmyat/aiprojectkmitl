    },
    {
      "question": "What are action and reaction forces?",
      "answer": "Action and reaction forces are a pair of forces that occur simultaneously and act on two interacting objects. The action force is exerted by the first object on the second object, while the reaction force is exerted by the second object back on the first object."

    {
      "question": "What is terminal velocity?",
      "answer": "Terminal velocity is the constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium through which it is falling (such as air or water) equals the force of gravity pulling it downward. At terminal velocity, the net force on the object is zero, so it no longer accelerates."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton's first law explain why a passenger lurches forward in a car when it suddenly stops?",
      "answer": "According to Newton's first law of motion, an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. When a car suddenly stops, the passengers continue to move forward due to their inertia until they are stopped by the force exerted by the seatbelt or airbag."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton's second law explain why it's harder to push a heavy object than a lighter one?",
